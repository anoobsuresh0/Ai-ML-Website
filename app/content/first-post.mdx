## Implementing AI for Growth

To implement AI for growth, consider the following steps:

```python
import ai_library

# Step 1: Gather relevant data
data = ai_library.load_data()

# Step 2: Preprocess the data
preprocessed_data = ai_library.preprocess(data)

# Step 3: Train your AI model
model = ai_library.train_model(preprocessed_data)

# Step 4: Evaluate and optimize the model
ai_library.evaluate_model(model)

# Step 5: Deploy the model and monitor its performance
ai_library.deploy_model(model)
```
